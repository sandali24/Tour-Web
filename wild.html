    <h3 id="best">The wildlife of Sri Lanka</h3>
    <h6>Sri Lanka is second to none in terms of its biodiversity and can be considered the best for big game safaris outside the African continent. As bold a statement as that may be, Sri Lanka’s wildlife credentials speak for itself.</h6>

    <h2 id="cina">Sri Lankan elephants</h2>
    <img src="wild1.jpeg" height=300px; width=260px;>
    <p>Elephants hold symbolic, cultural and economic importance in Sri Lanka. They attract tourists who visit national parks to observe elephants in the wild. They support logging operations by dragging felled logs and have special significance in religious events.</p>
    <p>
        The Sri Lankan elephant (Elephas maximus maximus ) is native to Sri Lanka and one of three recognised subspecies of the Asian elephant. It is the type subspecies of the Asian elephant and was first described by Carl Linnaeus under the binomial Elephas maximus in 1758.
        The Sri Lankan elephant population is now largely restricted to the dry zone in the north, east and southeast of Sri Lanka. </p><p>
        Elephants are present in Udawalawe National Park, Yala National Park, Lunugamvehera National Park, Wilpattu National Park and Minneriya National Park but also live outside protected areas.
         It is estimated that Sri Lanka has the highest density of elephants in Asia. 
        Human-elephant conflict is increasing due to conversion of elephant habitat to settlements and permanent cultivation.

    <h2 id="kota"> Sri Lankan leopards</h2>
    <img src="wild2.jpeg" height=350px; width=290px;>

    <p>The Sri Lankan leopard has a tawny or rusty yellow coat with dark spots and close-set rosettes. The Sri Lankan leopard has possibly evolved to become a rather large leopard subspecies, because it is the apex predator in the country. Large males have been suggested to reach almost 100 kg (220 lb), but evidence for this is lacking.</p>
      <p>Melanistic leopards are rare. Few records exist, including from Mawuldeniya, Pitadeniya, and Nallathanniya.[5] In October 2019, the Department of Wildlife Conservation recorded live footage of a melanistic individual for the first time, a male.
        The Sri Lankan leopard is still found in all habitats throughout the island in both protected and unprotected areas.
      </p> 
        <p>In Yala National Park, the Sri Lankan leopard as in other locations, is a solitary hunter, with the exception of females with young. Male's ranges typically overlap the smaller ranges of several females, as well as portions of the ranges of neighboring males,
             although exclusive core areas are apparent. They are more active and prefer hunting at night, but are also somewhat active during dawn, dusk, and daytime hours. They rarely haul their kills into trees, which is likely due to the lack of intraguild competition and the relative abundance of prey. In 2001 to 2002, adult resident leopard density was 
             estimated at 12.1 mature individuals and 21.7 individuals of all ages per 100 km2 (39 sq mi) in Block I of Yala National Park.</p>

    <h2 id="cape">Peacocks</h2>
    <img src="wild3.jpeg" height=350px; width=290px;>

    <p>The magnificent peacock is a bird native to the island of Sri Lanka, with their distinctive calls being heard all over the jungles. For such colorful 
        creatures, they are surprisingly shy by nature, hence the best place to find one is within
         the boundaries of the numerous national parks, hiding from the daily hustle bustle of Sri Lankan life.</p>
      <p>Being the largest of the pheasants, the peacock is a native bird to both Sri Lanka and India. Most often, the ones that you see on photographs with the beautiful plumage are the male peacocks – after which the simile ‘proud as a peacock’ was formed! The female pea hen does not have the lovely ornamental feathers and bright colors. Pea fowl are quite readily tamed and can sometimes be seen in the lawns of hotels or within the garden of large private residences in Sri Lanka.

        While on a safari at the Yala National Park, peacocks are a common sight. They could be displaying its fan of feathers or perched up and camouflaged at the top of trees. Peafowl – which is the actual term for peacocks and peahens together, have an average life span of 20 years when living in the wild. In Sri Lanka, they can be found in the jungles of Eastern, Northern and Southern provinces. If driving through the Hambantota district in Southern Sri Lanka, you can see them strolling on the streets as well.</p> 
        <p>The best time to observe peacocks is in the early morning when males gather around females, shouting loudly and stretching out their lovely feathers to create a beautiful dance. This is how they attracts the females and it is indeed one of the most gorgeous observations of Mother Nature.</p>
        <p>So why is it that the male has such an amazing fan of feathers? Well, most obviously, to attract the ladies when in courtship display. The peacock with the biggest and best fan is normally awarded the girl! Most often, successful males are capable of controlling a group of peahens. The females can lay about3-5 eggs and are ground feeders – eat insects, seed, vegetable matter and other small creatures.</p>

    <h2 id="peace">Sri Lankan junglefowl</h2>
    <img src="wild4.jpeg" height=300px; width=290px;>
    <p>As with other junglefowl, the Sri Lankan junglefowl is strongly sexually dimorphic; the male is much larger than the female, with more vivid plumage and a highly exaggerated wattle and comb.</p>
    <p>The Sri Lankan junglefowl is most closely related to the grey junglefowl,[6] though physically the male resembles the red junglefowl. Female Sri Lanka junglefowl are very similar to those of the grey junglefowl. Like the green junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl are island species that have evolved side by side with their similarly stranded island predators and competitors. Uniquely complex anti-predator behaviors and foraging strategies are integral components in the long evolutionary story of the Sri Lankan junglefowl.
    </p>
    <p>As with other jungle fowl, Sri Lankan jungle fowl are primarily terrestrial. They spend most of their time foraging for food by scratching the ground for various seeds, fallen fruit, and insects.

        Females lay two to four eggs in a nest, either on the forest floor in steep hill country or in the abandoned nests of other birds and squirrels. Like the grey and green junglefowl, male Sri Lankan junglefowl play an active role in nest protection and chick rearing.</p>
